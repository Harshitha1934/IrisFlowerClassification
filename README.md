# IrisFlowerClassification
Iris Flowers Classification is a Machine learning model wherein the species of different flowers can be identified based on the length of their respective petals and sepals. It works based on Logistic Regression.
Algorithms used for prediction are:
1.Dicision tree classifier
2.K nearest classifier
3.SVM
4.Logistic Regression
5.metrics
6.train_test_split We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
